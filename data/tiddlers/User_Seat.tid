User Seat is the source of truth for user's membership in SpaceStation. 

1. seat_status = active means user currently belongs to company. 
    seat_status = inactive means the user does NOT belong to company, but did in the past


2. compan_status = active/inactivate means if company has active Spaceman::Reservation or not.


3. user_status = active/inactive means if user belongs to an active company or not (doesnâ€™t say if user has a membership assigned or not..)

A user could be user_status = active, but still have no membership and thus not be able to do anything (cannot log into members-web). Or user could be user_status=inactive, but still belong to the company and still be able to log into account-central to do admin tasks, etc
