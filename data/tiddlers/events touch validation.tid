Note: events is constantly changing, as the consolidation and associations between campaign, campaign_member, journey, lead and contact. So this data may be different. 

To do regression test, we suggest make a copy of this model from production to dev.


```
create or replace table growth__dev.growthtech_dw.salesfunnel_channeltouch_events as
select * from  growth.growthtech_dw.salesfunnel_channeltouch_events
```

Validation SQL query


```
with dev as (
select count(1) as total_count, count(distinct touch_id) as touch_count
from growth__dev.growthtech_dw.salesfunnel_channeltouch_events
where touch_ts<dateadd(day, -14, current_date()) 
),
prod as (
select count(1) as total_count, count(distinct touch_id) as touch_count
from growth.growthtech_dw.salesfunnel_channeltouch_events
where touch_ts<dateadd(day, -14, current_date()) 
)
select *
from ( 
    select
    'total count' as check_point,
    prod.total_count as value_before ,
    dev.total_count as value_after,
    dev.total_count - prod.total_count as change_in_value
    from prod, dev
    union all
    select
    'touch count' as check_point,
    prod.touch_count as value_before,
    dev.touch_count as value_after,
    dev.touch_count - prod.touch_count as change_in_value
    from prod, dev
    )
where change_in_value <> 0
```
